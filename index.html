            Hi! This is the personal blog for Dan Thompson (<a href="https://twitter.com/LeedsDBA">@LeedsDBA</a>). Thanks for visiting!
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm re-writting this personal blog using GitHub pages and Jekyll (I think!). Don't worry, I've still got my old blog posts - but since Azure pulled external mysql hosting now they're doing things within Azure I don't have a database any more (oh, the irony!!). So I thought I'd use this as motivation to learn how to use GitHub pages like all the cool people. I'll be sure to send out a big tweet via @LeedsDBA when it's ready!
